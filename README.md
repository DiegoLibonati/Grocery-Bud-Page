## Description

I made a web page that allows you to add items to a list. These items can be edited and deleted. There is also a button to delete all items in the list. It is important to note that every item that is added, is saved in the LocalStorage. This allows to keep the items in each update of the page.

## Technologies used

1. Javascript
2. CSS3
3. HTML5
